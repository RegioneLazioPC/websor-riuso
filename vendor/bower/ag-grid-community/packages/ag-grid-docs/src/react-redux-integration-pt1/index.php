       This section introduces how React components using the ag-Grid Data Table can take advantage of a Redux store to
       simplify state management.

<p>
        We will use the concrete example of a file view component to demonstrate how to move local component state to
        a Redux store. Updates to the files state will be retrieved from the Redux store, while UI events to add and
        delete files will be dispatched to the Redux store for processing.

    </p>

    <p>
        As shown above, files are grouped by folder, and files can be added or deleted via context menu options.
    </p>

    <note>This section assumes the reader is familiar with React and ES6 Javascript features.</note>

    <h2 id="do-i-need-redux">Do I need Redux?</h2>

    <p>Redux excels in applications with complex state interactions. If you are passing unrelated data through several
       layers of components or data is shared and synchronized between different parts your application, you could
       benefit from Redux.</p>

    <p>When using Redux, you move state from your components into a single immutable store, where state is replaced rather
       than mutated. This combined with its unidirectional data flow can make it easier to test and reason about state
       changes in your application.</p>

    <h2 id="redux-architecture">Redux Architecture</h2>

    <p>Redux has a single store which contains all application state. It has one Root Reducer which is responsible for
       transforming the application state and is typically created by combining several smaller reducers.</p>

    <img style="margin-left: 15%" src="redux-store.png" alt="Redux Store" />

    <p>Actions describe the operation the reducer should perform on the state. They may also contain an optional payload
       containing data used by the reducer to transform the state. For example an action to create a new file might
       look like this:
    </p>

<snippet language="js">
{
    type: ‘NEW_FILE’,
    payload: {
        folder: 'pdf'
    }
}</snippet>

    <p>Actions are dispatched to the store from UI components as illustrated below:</p>

    <img style="margin-left: 2%" src="redux-data-flow.png" width="100%" alt="Redux Data Flow" />

    <p>The reducer that is associated with the action type will then transform the state which is saved in the store.
        Reducers are pure functions which receive the current application state along with the action to be performed on
        that state to produce some new state.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 20%; font-size: 20px"><b> (currentState, action) => newState </b></p>

    <p>UI components can subscribe to the store for specific parts of the state in order to be notified when there are
        changes to the store. This allows components to retrieve the latest state to refresh the view.
    </p>

    <h2 id="creating-redux-file-store">Creating our Redux File Store</h2>

    <p>
        To create our Redux File Store we will use the <code>createStore</code> factory method from the redux module.
        In our example we just require a single reducer which is supplied along with the initial state as shown below:
    </p>

<snippet language="jsx">
// store.jsx

import {createStore} from 'redux';
import fileReducer from './reducers/fileReducer.jsx';

const initialState = {
    files: [
        {id: 1, file: 'notes.txt', folder: 'txt'},
        {id: 2, file: 'book.pdf', folder: 'pdf'},
        {id: 3, file: 'cv.pdf', folder: 'pdf'},
        // more files ...
    ]
};

export default createStore(fileReducer, initialState);
</snippet>

    <p>Note that in larger applications there will typically be several reducers which are combined to create a single
       root reducer. This is done using the <code>combineReducers</code> function also from Redux.</p>

    <p>Our File View will allow users to add and delete files. The logic for handling these
       operations will be defined in the <code>fileReducer</code> shown below:
    </p>

<snippet language="jsx">
// reducers/fileReducer.jsx

export default function fileReducer(state = {}, action) {
    const payload = action.payload;
    switch (action.type) {
        case types.NEW_FILE:
            return {
                files: [
                    ...state.files,
                    newFile(state.files, payload.folder)
                ]
            };
        case types.DELETE_FILE:
            return {
                files: deleteFile(state.files, payload.id)
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
</snippet>

    <p>The <code>fileReducer</code> handles each action type with a case clause within a switch statement. It's important
        to understand that the reducer doesn't modify the state directly but instead returns a new version for the store
        to persist. As a result there must not be any side effects contained within the reducer.
    </p>

    <note>The helper methods used in the reducer are omitted for brevity but can be examined in the code tab provided
        in the example at the end of this section.
    </note>

    <p>
        Rather than create action objects directly, a more elegant approach is to create helper functions referred to as
        Action Creators as shown below:
    </p>


<snippet>
// actions/fileActions.jsx

export const actions = {
    newFile(folder) {
        return {
            type: types.NEW_FILE,
            payload: {folder}
        };
    },
    deleteFiles(id) {
        return {
            type: types.DELETE_FILES,
            payload: {id}
        };
    }
};
</snippet>

    <h2 id="adding-provider-component">Adding the Provider Component</h2>

    <p>Now that we have created our Redux store, we need to make it available to our React <code>FileView</code>
       component. This is achieved through the <code>Provider</code> component from the react-redux project.
    </p>

    <p>In the entry point of our application we wrap the <code>FileView</code> component in the <code>Provider</code> component
       as shown below:
    </p>

<snippet>
// index.jsx

import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';

import store from './store.jsx';
import FileView from './FileView.jsx';

render(
    &lt;Provider store={store}>
        &lt;FileView/>
    &lt;/Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
</snippet>

    <p>
        The <code>Provider</code> accepts the store as property and makes it available via props to all child components.
    </p>

    <h2 id="binding-react-and-redux">Binding React and Redux</h2>

    <p>In order for our File View to be updated when the store changes we need to bind it.</p>

    <p>This is achieved via the <code>connect</code> function provided by the react-redux project.</p>

<snippet>
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {connect} from "react-redux";
import {bindActionCreators} from 'redux';

class FileView extends Component {
    render() {
        /******* Warning, not a real implementation of render(), eg no html! */
        /******* The proper render method is given later. */

        // an immutable copy of the file state is accessed using:
        this.props.files;

        // the following actions can be dispatched to the store:
        this.props.actions.newFile(filePath);
        this.props.actions.deleteFiles(filePath);
    }
}

// map files to this.props from the store state
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    files: state.files
});

// bind our actions to this.props
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    actions: bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch)
});

// connect our component to the redux store
export default connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
    null,
    { forwardRef: true } // must be supplied for react/redux when using GridOptions.reactNext
)(FileView);
</snippet>
    <p>
        In the code above we pass two functions to <code>connect</code> to map the required state (mapStateToProps) and
        actions (mapDispatchToProps). When binding our actions we are using the <code>bindActionCreators</code> utility
        which wraps our action creators into a <code>dispatch</code> call.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that our stateless <code>FileView</code> component is connected to our Redux store, whenever the file
        state in the store changes, our component will re-render with the latest file state available in
        <code>this.props.files</code>.
    </p>

    <note>Bindings exist for most major javascript frameworks so Redux is not limited to React applications.</note>

    <h2 id="adding-the-data-table">Adding the Data Table</h2>

    <p>
        Now that the Redux store is now connected to our stateless React component, all that remains is to implement the
        view, which just consists of the ag-Grid Data Table in our File View.
    </p>

    <p>
       Before discussing the grid features in our File View, here are all of the grid options we are using:
    </p>

<snippet language="jsx">
// FileView.jsx

render() {
    return (
        &lt;div className="ag-theme-fresh">
            &lt;AgGridReact
                // provide column definitions
                columnDefs={this.colDefs}
                // specify auto group column definition
                autoGroupColumnDef={this.autoGroupColumnDef}
                // row data provided via props from the file store
                rowData={this.props.files}
                // expand groups by default
                groupDefaultExpanded={-1}
                // provide context menu callback
                getContextMenuItems={this.getContextMenuItems}
                // enable delta updates
                deltaRowDataMode={true}
                // return id required for delta updates
                getRowNodeId={data => data.id}>
            &lt;/AgGridReact>
        &lt;/div>
    )
}
</snippet>

    <h2>Row Grouping</h2>

    <p>To keep our File View example simple, we'll let the grid manage row grouping. This is achieved via the following
       configuration:
    </p>

<snippet>
colDefs = [
    {field: "file"},
    {field: "folder", rowGroup: true, hide: true},
    {field: "dateModified"},
    {field: "size"}
];

autoGroupColumnDef = {
    headerName: "Files",
    sort: 'asc',
    cellRendererParams: {
        suppressCount: true
    }
};
</snippet>

    <p>
        Here we are grouping files by folder with <code>rowGroup: true</code> on the folder column definition. We
        also override some of the defaults on our auto group column through the <code>autoGroupColumnDef</code> property.
    </p>

    <p>
        For more details see our documentation on <a href="../javascript-grid-grouping/">Row Grouping</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="row-data-updates">Row Data Updates</h2>
    <p>
        The initial file state along with all subsequent state updates will be provided to the grid component via
        <code>rowData={this.props.files}</code> from our Redux file store.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means the grid does not change the state of the files internally but instead receives the new state from
        the Redux store!
    </p>

    <h2 id="context-menu-actions">Context Menu Actions</h2>
    <p>
        As shown above, <code>getContextMenuItems={this.getContextMenuItems}</code> supplies a function to the grid to
        retrieve the context menu items. Here is the implementation:
    </p>

<snippet>
getContextMenuItems = (params) => {
    const folderActions = [{
        name: "New File",
        action: () => this.props.actions.newFile(params.node.key)
    }];

    const fileActions = [{
        name: "Delete File",
        action: () => this.props.actions.deleteFile(params.node.data.id)
    }];

    return params.node.group ? folderActions : fileActions;
};
</snippet>

    <p>
        Notice that we are simply dispatching actions to the Redux store here. For example,
        when the new file menu item is selected: <code>action: () => this.props.actions.newFile(folder)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to note that nothing will happen inside the grid when a menu item is selected until the Redux
        store triggers a re-render of the grid component with the updated state.
    </p>

    <p>
        For more details see our documentation on <a href="../javascript-grid-context-menu/">Context Menu</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="delta-updates">Delta Row Updates</h2>
    <p>
        One consequence of using Redux is that when part of the state is updated in the store, the entire state is replaced
        with a new version. Delta Row Updates is designed to work specifically with immutable stores such as Redux to ensure
        only the rows that have been updated will be re-rendered inside the grid.
    </p>
    <p>
        The File View enables this feature using: <code>deltaRowDataMode={true}</code>, along with a required row id
        using: <code>getRowNodeId={data => data.id}</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This feature can lead to noticeable performance improvements in applications which contain alot of row data.
        For more details see our documentation on <a href="../javascript-grid-data-update/#delta-row-data">Delta Row Updates</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Demo - Redux File View</h2>

    <p> Now we are ready to enjoy the fruits of our labour! The completed Redux File View with source code is shown
        below. In this example you can:
    </p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li><b>Folder 'Right Click':</b> reveals option to add a new file under the selected folder.</li>
        <li><b>File 'Right Click':</b> reveals option to delete the selected file.</li>
        <li><b>'Reload Component' button:</b> unmounts and then re-mounts the File View component. Notice that
            state is preserved via our Redux file store!</li>
    </ul>

    <?= example('Redux File View', 'redux-file-view', 'react', array("enterprise" => 1, "extras" => array( "fontawesome" ))) ?>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        While implementing the Redux File View, we have demonstrated how we can move local state out of our components,
        along with all the associated state operations, to a Redux state container. This led to a nice separation of
        concerns, allowing our view component to focus on presentation detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this example we just touched on a few grid features to keep the example simple. These features included:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Row Grouping</li>
        <li>Delta Row Updates</li>
        <li>Custom Context Menu</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Next up in <a href="../react-redux-integration-pt2/">Redux Integration Part 2</a> we take things further and
        implement a feature rich File Browser which builds upon this File View example.
