    <h1 class="first-h1" id="floating-rows">Row Pinning</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        Pinned rows appear either above or below the normal rows of a table.
        This feature in other grids is also known as <strong>Frozen Rows</strong> or <strong>Pinned Rows</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To put pinned rows into your grid, set <code>pinnedTopRowData</code> or <code>pinnedBottomRowData</code>
        in the same way as you would set normal data into <code>rowData</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the grid is created, you can update the pinned rows by calling <code>api.setPinnedTopRowData(rows)</code>
        and <code>setPinnedBottomRowData(rows)</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Cell Editing</h2>

    <p>
        Cell editing can take place as normal on pinned rows.
    </p>

    <h2>Cell Rendering</h2>

    <p>
        Cell rendering can take place as normal on pinned rows. There is an additional
        <code>colDef.pinnedRowCellRenderer</code> property you can use to give pinned row cell a
        different <code>cellRenderer</code> to the other cells. If both <code>cellRenderer</code> and <code>pinnedRowCellRenderer</code>
        are provided, pinned rows will use <code>pinnedRowCellRenderer</code> over <code>cellRenderer</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>
        Example below shows pinned rows. Select the number of rows you want to pin at the top and the
        bottom using the selection above the grid.
    </p>

    <p>In this example we're using Components to render custom pinned row values for Athlete and Age (color blue and italics
    respectively).</p>

    <h2>Non Supported Items</h2>

    <p>
        Pinned rows are not part of the main row model. For this reason, the following is not possible:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Sorting</b>: Pinned rows cannot be sorted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Filtering</b>: Pinned rows are not filtered.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Row Grouping</b>: Pinned rows cannot be grouped.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Row Selection</b>: Pinned rows cannot be selected.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
