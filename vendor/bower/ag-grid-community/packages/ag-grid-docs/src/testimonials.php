                        <p>When we were looking for a grid solution for our Web App, we had a lot of demands in out mind.
At first it seemed ag-Grid was to true to be  true, and it lived up to the expectation!

First of all its is very customisable,you can play and change every element in the grid with ease.
The filters/sorting/grouping/searching are working so fast on large data (we tested up to 80k rows), just like magic.

AG-Grid has made my life as a developer a lot easier
