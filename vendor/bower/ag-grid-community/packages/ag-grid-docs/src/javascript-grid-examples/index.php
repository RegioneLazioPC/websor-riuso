    <h1>Examples</h1>

    <p class="lead">In this section we show 
            complex examples combining different features of the grid 
            or using frameworks where the implementation is significantly different to
            the plain JavaScript version. For example how to build use Redux with React, or RxJS with Angular.
    </p>

    If you are looking for a particular feature, please refer to the features section for details
    on that feature. Use this section for reference on how to configure ag-Grid.

        <p>This section of the documentation demonstrates different configurations of the grid. It is really a mixed bag section, showing combinations of grid features working together that doesn't fit into a particular documentation section.</p>

        <h2>Graphing</h2>
        <p>Sometimes however a picture (or graph) is worth a thousand words, so in this section we offer some examples of how you can interact with external Graphs, or embed Graphs into ag-Grid itself. </p>
