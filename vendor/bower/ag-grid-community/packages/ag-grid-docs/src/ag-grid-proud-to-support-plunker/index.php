        <h3>Why Plunker?</h3>

        <p>
            Many of you will already be using <a href="https://plnkr.co/">Plunker</a>, it's the best tool to prototype, experiment, share and debug your ideas on the web platform. From idea to implementation, <a href="https://plnkr.co/">Plunker</a> helps you build something quickly and frictionlessly. It's our tool of choice for <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-examples/">examples</a> in our <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/documentation-main/documentation.php/">Documentation.</a> We also use it extensively when delivering support to our customers. 
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of last year, we got in contact with Geoff Goodman, creator of Plunker, and we quickly found common ground. This led to us providing support for Geoff and his team. As Geoff says:
        </p>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
            <i>"We are really excited to be working with ag-Grid. With their regular support, we can drive exciting new and improved experiences for the users of the Plunker platform."</i>
            </blockquote>
        </p>
            It's important to us that we give back to the community which supported us in our early days. Projects such as <a href="https://plnkr.co/">Plunker</a> provide an amazing service at no charge so it's only fair that they are compensated for their time and effort.
        </p>

        <h3>Corporate ‘Open-Source’ Social Responsibility</h3>

        <p>
            We first came up with the concept of Corporate ‘Open-Source’ Social Responsibility through our support of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>. In that <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-partners-with-webpack/">blog post</a>, we hoped that we could continue this initiative and we're delighted to have found another worthy recipient of our support. We love Plunker, it saves us lots of time and is a great product.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also love the idea of giving back, we'll be on the lookout for other projects that fit with our vision. We strongly enourage you to do the same at your company.
        </p>
