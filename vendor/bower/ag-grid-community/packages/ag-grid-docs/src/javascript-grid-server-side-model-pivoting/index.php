<h1 class="heading-enterprise"> Pivoting </h1>

<p class="lead">
    In this section we add Server-side Pivoting to create an example with the ability to 'Slice and Dice' data using
    the Server-side Row model.
</p>

<h2>Pivoting</h2>

<p>
    Now that we have covered <a href="../javascript-grid-server-side-model-grouping/">Row Grouping</a> we are
    now going to add server-side pivoting. This will allow the user to 'Slice and Dice' the data, meaning the
    user can decide what they want to group, aggregate and pivot on by dragging the columns around in the grid.
</p>

<p>
    When the user changes the status of the columns (ie the user changes how the data is grouped, aggregated
    or pivoted) then the grid data is cleared out and loaded again from scratch using the new configuration.
</p>

<h2>Example - Slice and Dice - Mocked Server</h2>
<p>
    A mock data store running inside the browser is used in the example below. The purpose of the mock server is to
    demonstrate the interaction between the grid and the server. For your application, your server will need to
    understand the requests from the client and build SQL (or the SQL equivalent if using a no-SQL data store) to run
    the relevant query against the data store.
</p>

<p>
    The example demonstrates the following:
</p>
<ul class="content">
    <li>
        Columns <code>Athlete, Age, Country, Year</code> and <code>Sport</code> all have <code>enableRowGroup=true</code>
        which means they can be grouped on. To group you drag the columns to the row group panel section.
        By default the example is grouping by <code>Country</code> and then <code>Year</code> as these columns have
        <code>rowGroup=true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Columns <code>Gold, Silver</code> and <code>Bronze</code> all have <code>enableValue=true</code> which means
        they can be aggregated on. To aggregate you drag the column to the <code>Values</code> section.
        When you are grouping, then all columns in the <code>Values</code> section will be aggregated.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can turn the grid into <strong>Pivot Mode</strong>. To do this, you click the pivot mode checkbox.
        When the grid is in pivot mode, the grid behaves similar to an Excel grid. This extra information
        is passed to your server as part of the request and it is your servers responsibility to return
        the data in the correct structure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Columns <strong>Athlete, Age, Country, Year</strong> and <strong>Sport</strong> all have <code>enablePivot=true</code> which means
        they can be pivoted on when <strong>Pivot Mode</strong> is active. To pivot you drag the column to the <strong>Pivot</strong>
        section.
    </li>
    <li>
        Note that when you pivot, it is not possible to drill all the way down the leaf levels.
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition to grouping, aggregation and pivot, the example also demonstrates filtering.
        The columns <b>Country</b> and <b>Year</b> have grid provided filters. The column <b>Age</b>
        has an example provided custom filter. You can use whatever filter you want, as long as
        your server-side knows what to do with it.
    </li>
</ul>

<?= example('Slice And Dice', 'slice-and-dice', 'generated', array("enterprise" => 1, "processVue" => true)) ?>

<note>
    When filtering using the Server-side Row Model it's important to specify the filter parameter: <code>newRowsAction: 'keep'</code>.
    This is to prevent the filter from being reset as data is loaded into the grid.
</note>

<h2>Pivoting Challenges</h2>

<p>
    Achieving pivot on the server-side is difficult. If you manage to implement it, you deserve lots of credit from
    your team and possibly a few hugs (disclaimer, we are not responsible for any inappropriate hugs you try). Here
    are some quick references on how you can achieve pivot in different relational databases:
    All databases will either implement pivot (like Oracle) or require you to fake it (like MySQL).
</p>
    <ul class="content">
        <li>Oracle: Oracle has native support for filtering which they call
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/sql/11g-pivot-097235.html">pivot feature</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            MySQL: MySQL does not support pivot, however it is possible to achieve by building SQL using
            inner select statements. See the following on Stack Overflow:
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7674786/mysql-pivot-table">MySQL Pivot Table</a> and
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12598120/mysql-pivot-table-query-with-dynamic-columns">
                MySQL Pivot Table Query with Dynamic Columns
            </a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>
    To understand <a href="../javascript-grid-pivoting/#pivot-mode">Pivot Mode</a> and
    <a href="../javascript-grid-pivoting/#secondary-columns">Secondary Columns</a> please refer to
    the relevant sections on <a href="../javascript-grid-pivoting/">Pivoting in Client-side Row Model</a>.
    The concepts mean the same in both Client-side Row Model and the Server-side Row Model.
</p>

<p>
    Secondary columns are the columns that are created as part of the pivot function. You must provide
    these to the grid in order for the grid to display the correct columns for the active pivot function.
    For example, if you pivot on <code>Year</code>, you need to tell the grid to create columns for
    <code>2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010</code> and <code>2012</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Secondary columns are defined identically to primary columns, you provide a list of
    <a href="../javascript-grid-column-definitions/">Column Definitions</a> to the grid. The columns are set
    by calling <code>columnApi.setSecondaryColumns()</code> and passing a list of columns and / or column
    groups. There is no limit or restriction as to the number of columns or groups you pass - the only
    thing you should ensure is that the field (or value getter) that you set for the columns matches.
</p>

<p>
    If you do pass in secondary columns with the server response, be aware that setting secondary columns
    will reset all secondary column state. For example if resize or reorder the columns, then setting the
    secondary columns again will reset this. In the example above, a hash function is applied to the secondary
    columns to check if they are the same as the last time the server was asked to process a request. This
    is the examples way to make sure the secondary columns are only set into the grid when they have actually
    changed.
</p>

<p>
    If you do not want pivot in your Server-side Row Model grid, then you can remove it from the tool
    panel by setting <code>toolPanelSuppressPivotMode=true</code> and
    <code>toolPanelSuppressValues=true</code>.
