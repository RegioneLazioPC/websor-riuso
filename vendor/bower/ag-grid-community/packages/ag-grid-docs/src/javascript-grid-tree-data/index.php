        provided as part of the data. For example, a folder can contain zero or more files and other folders.
    </p>

    </p>
        This section introduces simple ways to work with Tree Data before covering more advanced use cases.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tree-data-mode">Tree Data Mode</h2>

    <p>
        In order to set the grid to work with Tree Data, simply enable Tree Data mode via the Grid Options using:
    </p>

<snippet>
    treeData = true
</snippet>

    <h2 id="supplying-tree-data">Supplying Tree Data</h2>

    <p>
        When providing tree data to the grid you implement the <code>gridOptions.getDataPath(data)</code> callback
        to tell the grid the hierarchy for each row. The callback returns back a <code>string[]</code> with each
        element specifying a level of the tree. Below follows two examples presenting the hierarchy in different ways.
    <p>

<snippet>
// sample hierarchy, Malcolm is child or Erica
  + Erica
    - Malcolm

// ############
// Example #1 - hierarchy in the data is already a string array
// ############
var rowData = [
    {orgHierarchy: ['Erica'], jobTitle: "CEO", employmentType: "Permanent"},
    {orgHierarchy: ['Erica', 'Malcolm'], jobTitle: "VP", employmentType: "Permanent"}
    ...
]
// just return the hierarchy, no conversion required
getDataPath: function(data) {
    return data.orgHierarchy;
}

// ############
// Example #2 - hierarchy is a path string, needs conversion
// ############
var rowData = [
    {path: "Erica", jobTitle: "CEO", employmentType: "Permanent"},
    {path: "Erica/Malcolm", jobTitle: "VP", employmentType: "Permanent"}
    ...
]
// callback converts eg "Erica/Malcolm" to ["Erica","Malcolm"]
getDataPath: function(data) {
    return data.path.split('/'); // path: "Erica/Malcolm"
}</snippet>

    <h2 id="configuring-a-group-column">Configuring Group Column</h2>

    <p>
        There are two ways to configure the Group Column:
    </p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li><b>Auto Column Group</b> -  this is automatically selected by the grid when in Tree Data mode, however
        you can override the defaults. </li>
        <li><b>Custom Column Group</b> - you can provide your own custom column group definition which gives allows
        more control over how the Group Column is displayed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Auto Column Group</h3>

    <p>
        When the grid is working with Tree Data there is no need to explicitly specify a Column Group as the grid will
        use the  <a href="../javascript-grid-grouping/#auto-column-group">Auto Column Group</a>. However you will
        probably want to override some of the defaults as shown below:
    </p>

<snippet>
autoGroupColumnDef: {
    headerName: "My Group",
    width: 300,
    cellRendererParams: {
        suppressCount: true
    }
}
</snippet>

    <h3>Custom Column Group</h3>

    <p>
        As noted above, providing your own Custom Column Group has the advantage of giving you full control over the
        presentation of the Column Group, however it is not as convenient as using the default Auto Column Group.
    </p>

    <p>
        One significant difference is that the entire <code>dataPath</code> array will be supplied as a value, rather
        than just the current node value.
    </p>

    <p>
        For details on how you can provide your own Custom Group Column see: <a href="../javascript-grid-grouping/#example-custom-grouping-many-group-columns">Specifying Group Columns</a>.
    </p>


    <note>
        It is <b>not</b> possible to have multiple group display columns for tree data like you do for row grouping.
        When doing tree data, you should only have one column for display the group.
    </note>

    <h2>Example - Organisational Hierarchy</h2>

    <p>
       The following example combines all the steps above to show a simplified organisational hierarchy:
    </p>

    <?= example('Org Hierarchy', 'org-hierarchy', 'generated', array("enterprise" => 1, "exampleHeight" => 375, 'processVue' => true)) ?>

    <h2 id="filler-nodes">Filler Groups</h2>

    <p>
        It is not necessary to include entries for each level in the path if data is not required at group levels as shown below:
    </p>

<snippet>
// all path levels provided
var rowData = [
    {filePath: ['Documents']},
    {filePath: ['Documents', 'txt']},
    {filePath: ['Documents', 'txt', 'notes.txt'], dateModified: "21 May 2017, 13:50", size: "14 KB"}
    ...
]

// only leaf level provided
var rowData = [
    {filePath: ['Documents', 'txt', 'notes.txt'], dateModified: "21 May 2017, 13:50", size: "14 KB"}
    ...
]</snippet>

    <p>
        The second variation above leaves out row data entries for 'Documents' and 'txt' nodes, in this case the grid
        will create <code>Filler Groups</code> for these.
    </p>

    <p>
        This following example includes the column 'Group Type' to highlight which nodes are 'provided' in the row data and
        which are generated by the grid as a 'filler' group:
    </p>

    <?= example('Filler Nodes', 'filler-nodes', 'generated', array("enterprise" => 1, "exampleHeight" => 300, 'processVue' => true)) ?>

    <note>
        As <code>Filler Groups</code> are generated by the grid they will not contain a <code>data</code> property on the <code>RowNode</code>.
        This could be a limitation if you wanted to provide an 'id' for each group even when there is no data displayed at group levels.
    </note>

    <h2 id="tree-data-aggregation">Tree Data Aggregation</h2>

    <p>
        When using Tree Data, columns defined with an aggregation function will always perform aggregations on the group nodes.
        This means any supplied group data will be ignored in favour of the aggregated values.
    </p>
    <p>
        However if there are no child nodes to aggregate it will default to the provided value in the row data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="#example-file-browser">File Browser</a> example below demonstrates aggregation
        on the 'size' column.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also you can refer to the section on <a href="../javascript-grid-aggregation/">Aggregation</a> more details.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tree-data-filtering">Tree Data Filtering</h2>

    <p>
        As Tree Data has parent / child relationships, by default all child nodes will be included when a parent passes
        a filter, and as filtering is performed across all group levels, a group will be included if:
        <dl style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <dd>a) it has any children that pass the filter, or</dd>
            <dd>b) its data passes the filter</dd>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <p>
        To override this behaviour to use regular filtering instead, enable the following Grid Options property:
    </p>

    <snippet>
        excludeChildrenWhenTreeDataFiltering = true
    </snippet>

    <p>
        Also note the <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-set/">Set Filter</a> will contain a list of all unique values
        across each level of the group hierarchy. The <a href="#example-file-browser">File Browser</a> example below
        demonstrates how the Set Filter works with Tree Data.
    </p>

    <h2>Example - File Browser</h2>

    <p>
        The following example presents a more complex example which includes Aggregation and Filtering:
    </p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li><b>'Add New Group' Button</b> - will add a new group under Music.</li>
        <li><b>'Move Selected to stuff' Button</b> - will move any non parent groups into the 'stuff' folder.</li>
        <li><b>'Remove Selected' Button</b> - will remove selected group along with children.</li>
        <li><b>'Files' Filter</b> - you can filter group and leaf names across the entire file tree.</li>
        <li><b>'Size' Aggregation</b> - as you move selected items into 'stuff' you'll notice updated folder sizes.</li>
    </ul>

    <?= example('File Browser', 'file-browser', 'generated', array('enterprise' => true, 'extras' => array('fontawesome'), 'processVue' => true) ) ?>

    <h2 id="only-one-column">Pivot and Row Grouping with Tree Data</h2>

    <p>
        It is not possible to do pivot or row grouping while using tree data. This means all the functions
        related to pivot (eg colDef.pivot, or pivot in the tool panel) and row grouping (eg colDef.rowGroup, or
        row group in the tool panel) will be disabled.
    </p>

    <h2 id="child-counts">Child Counts</h2>

    <p>
        If you are showing child counts for the groups, then the child count is a count of all children and grand children.
        This is different to <a href="../javascript-grid-grouping/">Row Grouping</a> where only leaf levels are counted,
        in tree data, all group children are also counted.
    </p>

    <h2 id="selection">Selection</h2>

    <p>
        To enable selection set <code>gridOptions.rowSelection</code> to 'single' or 'multiple'
        as normal. However there are some restrictions to be aware of.
    </p>

    <h3>Selecting Groups and Children</h3>

    <p>
        The property <code>groupSelectsChildren</code> does not work with tree data. This is because
        groups in tree data are rows passed by the application that may or may not have children - a
        group is simply a normal row that has another row as a child. Given groups and leaf nodes
        are logically identical, it is not possible to treat them differently in selection.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to achieve something similar to <code>groupSelectsChildren</code> then you should
        listen on the selection events and do the selection yourself in your application. You will come
        across edge cases where only your application will understand what the best selection outcome is.
    </p>

    <h3>Checkbox vs Click Selection</h3>

    <p>
        Click selection is supported with tree data. However when you are displaying tree data, clicking
        rows for selection is confusing as mouse clicks are also used for expanding / contracting rows.
        For this reason we recommend not using click selecting and preferring checkbox selection instead.
    </p>

    <snippet>var gridOptions = {

    // don't have click select rows
    suppressRowClickSelection: true,

    // have checkbox on the group column
    autoGroupColumnDef: {
        cellRendererParams: {
            checkbox: true,
        }
    }

    ...
}</snippet>

    <h3>Group Selection</h3>

    <p>
        Filler groups do not keep their selection state should the filler group be moved.
        For example if you have groups A->B->C, where C is the only row provided (so the grid
        creates groups A and B for you), and then you change the patch to D->B->C, group B
        will not keep it's selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        If keeping selection of groups is a priority, then arrange your data so that the
        grid does not need to create any filler groups.
    </p>
