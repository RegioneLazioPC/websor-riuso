    <h1>Plain JavaScript Examples</h1>

    <p>
        Here we show some examples in plain JavaScript combining different features of the grid.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a href="../example-file-browser/" class="column-links column-items">File Browser</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
        File Browser changes the look and feel of the grid to make it behave like a Microsoft Windows
        file browser. We don't expect you to re-create Windows File Browser, however it demonstrates
        the flexibility of the grid's styling.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a href="../example-account-report/" class="column-links column-items">Styled Report</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
        The Styled Report shows how the grid doesn't need to look like a typical grid. This report
        looks like something out of a presentation.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a href="../example-expressions-and-context/" class="column-links column-items">Expressions and Context</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
        This example is similar to what finance departments might build. It shows how to use value getters
        to build expressions.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a href="../example-excel-import/" class="column-links column-items">Excel Import</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
        Illustrates how you might utilise a third-party library to import an Excel spreadsheet into ag-Grid.
    </p>
