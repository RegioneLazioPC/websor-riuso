    <h1>Custom Filter</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        There are several ways to refine the way your column filters look & feel in ag-grid.
        They all based around components which mean that you can use your favourite framework too:

        <ol class="content">
            <li>Create <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-component/">your own custom filter</a></li>
            <li>Create <a href="../javascript-grid-floating-filter-component/">your own custom floating filter</a></li>
            <li>Create <a href="../javascript-grid-date-component/">your own custom date component</a> and customise your own date picker. (Applies to the default date filter
                and the date floating filter)
            </li>
